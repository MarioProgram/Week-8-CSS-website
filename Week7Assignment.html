    <div class="about">
        <p class="intro">
                I immigrated from Mexico when i was 3 years old. Grew up and currently live in Arizona. Went to Westwood Highschool and joined the JROTC program. I met my wife there and started dating my final year there.
                We have been together for 8 years and she is still my best  friend. I competed with our drill team in JROTC winning competitions around Arizona. After  Highschool I was unsure what to do as a career. I worked 
                a few different jobs trying to figure what I enjoyed. For the past 5 years I have been with The Home Depot working as a customer service representative over phone for online orders then moving to their online chat team and <br> currently 
                still doing that. I finally decided I want a career in tech after years of conteplating 
                what to do.
